# TcNo Ark Player Migrator
I've been playing Ark for a while through the Epic Games store (got it for free).
You can't join modded servers, see ping on the server list and other issues. So I bought it on Steam, as well as all the DLC.
I had progress on my locally hosted dedicated server where I played with friends, and didn't want to lose it.

That's what this project is for. It opens an existing arkprofile, as well as another arkprofile, and changes the unique ID in the newer one with the first. Swapping IDs should let you load in as another profile.
This seemed to work, but I can't verify as I need to download Ark on the Epic Games store a second time to make sure. It worked perfectly, then had some issues trying to do it again. Needs more testing.
